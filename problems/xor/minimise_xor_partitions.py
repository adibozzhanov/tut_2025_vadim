You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

Your task is to partition nums into k non-empty

. For each subarray, compute the bitwise XOR of all its elements.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum XOR among these k subarrays.

Note: Please do not copy the description during the contest to maintain the integrity of your submissions.

def solve(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
    

    return 0

solve([1,1,2,3,1], 2)
